# 🧪 Extended System Programming Laboratory (202-1-2041)

## 📘 Course Overview

This course focuses on **low-level system programming** using the **Linux** operating system. It emphasizes hands-on experience in **C programming**, **assembly (x86)**, and **binary-level tools**, aiming to deepen understanding of how software interfaces with system hardware and operating system services.

The course is taught in **English**, including all labs and the final exam.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

1. Processes, memory models, and OS-level interaction
2. Introduction to C programming: storage types, pointers, structures
3. Basics of **x86 assembly** and linking with C
4. System calls and programmer–kernel interaction
5. Linux file system, process management, and permissions
6. Command interpreters (shells)
7. Binary file formats and manipulation
8. The **ELF format**: structure, linking, and loading

## 🛠️ Skills Gained

- Writing efficient low-level C and assembly programs
- Debugging using `gdb` and `valgrind`
- Implementing custom tools (e.g., shell, hex editor, virus detector)
- Reading and patching ELF executables
- Process control, job management, and inter-process communication

---

## 💡 Notes

- Labs build progressively on previous work
- Some tasks require direct memory or binary manipulation
- Submissions must follow strict file and format guidelines
