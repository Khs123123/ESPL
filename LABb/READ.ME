# 🧪 Lab B – Linked Lists, Binary Files, and Virus Detection

## 📘 Overview

In this lab, we practiced low-level programming in C, focusing on dynamic memory, linked lists, binary file handling, and basic virus detection and neutralization techniques. We also used **Valgrind** to detect memory leaks and ensure correct memory usage.

> 👥 This lab **may be done in pairs**.

## 🎯 Lab Goals

- Understand and implement **linked lists** in C
- Read and interpret **binary file formats**
- Build a **virus signature detector**
- Use `fread`, `memcmp`, `fseek`, `fwrite` for file operations
- Apply **Valgrind** to debug memory issues
- Simulate an anti-virus tool by neutralizing known patterns in executables

---

## 🗂️ Deliverables

- `AntiVirus.c` – Full program: linked list, detection, neutralization
- `makefile` – Builds the program with `make`
- Final executable should be named `virusDetector`
