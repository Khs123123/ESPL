# ðŸ§ª Lab 3 â€“ Assembly Language & System Calls

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

In this lab, we explored low-level programming in x86 assembly and system call usage without relying on the C standard library. The lab emphasizes direct interaction with the Linux kernel, encoding logic, and simple virus-like behavior.

> âœ… This lab may be done in pairs.

## ðŸŽ¯ Main Goals

- Write simple programs in assembly using system calls
- Call assembly from C and vice versa
- Handle file I/O and command-line arguments without `stdio.h`
- Use `sys_getdents` to list directory contents
- Append binary code to other executable files
