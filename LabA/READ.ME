# 🧪 Lab 1 – C Programming in a Linux Environment

## 📘 Overview

This lab introduces basic C programming in a Linux (32-bit) environment. The assignment focuses on command-line argument parsing, stream-based I/O, character encoding, debug modes, and using `make` to build a small project.

> 🧍‍♂️ This lab must be done **solo**.

## 🎯 Lab Goals

- Parse command-line arguments (`argc`, `argv`)
- Implement a debug mode
- Read and write characters using `fgetc`, `fputc`
- Encode characters based on a numeric key (cyclic shift)
- Support input/output redirection using `-i` and `-o`
- Build with `make` and no unnecessary libraries

---

## 📂 Files

- `encoder.c` – C source for the encoder program
- `makefile` – Builds the program with `make encoder`

The final executable must be named `encoder`.
